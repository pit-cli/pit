# pit

Do you like forgetting where you left your code? How about getting blamed for forgetting to push your latest change? Pit is here to save you from, well, yourself.

Pit is a high performance CLI tool written entirely in Golang.

Pit is meant to solve git project management across repository sources (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Forgejo, bare metal), repo management (uncommitted files, stashed files, repository sync) and integrating natively with git for version control.

## Features
- Cross domain repository organization
- Identify stray repos
- Summarize repo status
- Find stashed files
- Stay up to date on major changes

## Status
Pit is under development. Loss of data is possible. This progran is currently not stable
